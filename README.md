# Flutter World Time App

A Flutter project to show times of different locations around the world. Built with Flutter for cross-platform mobile apps (Android & iOS), it fetches real-time data from the World Time API for accurate, timezone-aware displays.

## Features

- **Location Selection**: Browse and choose from a list of global cities and regions.
- **Dynamic Home Screen**: View current time with day/night mode themes for an immersive experience.
- **Offline Fallback**: Basic caching for quick loads (API-dependent for updates).
- **Clean UI**: Simple, intuitive navigation with smooth animations.
